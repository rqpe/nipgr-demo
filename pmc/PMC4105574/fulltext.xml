One barrier is the belief that climate change is too uncertain, and likely to happen in distant places and times, to people unlike oneself. Related to this perceived psychological distance of climate change, studies have shown that direct experience of the effects of climate change increases climate change concern. The present study examined the relationship between physical proximity to the coastline and climate change belief, as proximity may be related to experiencing or anticipating the effects of climate change such as sea-level rise. We show, in a national probability sample of 5,815 New Zealanders, that people living in closer proximity to the shoreline expressed greater belief that climate change is real and greater support for government regulation of carbon emissions. This proximity effect held when adjusting for height above sea level and regional poverty. The model also included individual differences in respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. The results indicate that physical place plays a role in the psychological acceptance of climate change, perhaps because the effects of climate change become more concrete and local.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Preparation of this manuscript was partially supported by a Marsden Fast Start grant from The Royal Society of New Zealand (Te Putea Rangahau a Marsden) awarded to Taciano L.

However, it is clear that climate change poses a unique and profoundly complex problem, one that is not easily communicated. A study found that only 53% of the New Zealand public believe climate change is real and caused by humans, while 10% do not believe in climate change, 7% believe it is real but not caused by humans, and a large proportion (31%) remain undecided <xref rid="pone.0103180-Sibley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Surveys conducted in the U.S. report similar results, with three showing that around 63&#x02013;69% of Americans believe global warming is happening <xref rid="pone.0103180-Borick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Pew1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and another reporting that 82% of Americans believe climate change is happening <xref rid="pone.0103180-Stanford1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Other Western countries also show relatively moderate levels of concern compared to climate scientists <xref rid="pone.0103180-Ratter1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. At the same time, support for action to reduce global warming is moderate to high: 64% of New Zealanders say that citizens should be exerting more effort toward combating climate change <xref rid="pone.0103180-Horizon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and, when they were shown 19 possible government policy options to reduce emissions, New Zealanders showed more support than opposition for all, with majority support for 17 of the policy options <xref rid="pone.0103180-Scoop1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Again similarly, 68% of the U.S. public supports medium to large-scale efforts to tackle climate change <xref rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Altogether, New Zealanders, similarly to Americans, want action taken on climate change, but it is clear that the public is significantly less certain about the threat than the scientists.</p><p>Scientists have tried communicating facts as one avenue to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and public perceptions of global climate change. But this deficit model of communication, which assumes that the public merely needs to be informed or enlightened via the presentation of facts in order to perceive the existing risks, is now largely considered to be too simple <xref rid="pone.0103180-Nerlich1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Lack of information is indeed one barrier for public awareness of climate change risks, in concert with the distortion of information due to the disproportionate representation of contrarians in popular media <xref rid="pone.0103180-Boykoff1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Oreskes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the idea of psychological barriers has been gaining traction: There are a whole host of potential attitudes, beliefs, and feelings that can hinder perceiving, understanding, and acting upon climate change. For example, the way people tend to conceive issues differs when the problem is only described to them, as opposed to experienced over time <xref rid="pone.0103180-Hertwig1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In one study, people's misconceptions about CO<sub>2</sub> were significantly reduced when they participated in a climate change simulator, as opposed to merely receiving summary information about it <xref rid="pone.0103180-Dutt1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additionally, in the last decades psychologists have identified numerous other barriers <xref rid="pone.0103180-Gifford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Swim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which include (but may not be limited to): uncertainty, skepticism, distrust in information sources, externalizing responsibility and blame, optimism bias, attention to other priorities, reluctance to change lifestyles, habit, fatalism, a &#x0201c;drop in the ocean&#x0201d; feeling, lack of perceived political, business, and/or industry action, ideological, political and religious beliefs, worry about free riders, social norms/expectations, lack of enabling initiatives, belief in technological salvation, and the perception that climate change is a distant threat.</p><p>In particular, this last barrier&#x02013;&#x02013;psychological distance&#x02013;&#x02013;manifests in feelings that the problem is too uncertain (likelihood distance), will occur far away (geographical distance), far in the future (temporal distance), and to people different from oneself (social distance) <xref rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For example, the geographical distance of environmental problems, including global warming, is apparent in respondents from 26 countries, who overall indicated that problems are likely to affect distant areas more severely than local ones <xref rid="pone.0103180-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Notably, the countries surveyed were both economically and environmentally diverse: Their Gross National Products varied widely, and the countries also varied on environmental performance in five domains, such as the level of local environmental impact on humans. The perceived geographical distance was unrelated to these objective indicators of country wealth and environmental quality&#x02013;&#x02013;that is, respondents from these countries tended to perceive global warming as affecting others more than themselves, even when they are poorer and/or more environmentally vulnerable than others. Self-reported psychological distance has also been shown to be associated with both lower climate change concern and diminished willingness to reduce energy use <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, suggesting that when people experience psychological distance, it negatively affects both their climate change concern and their willingness to take action.</p><p>The strength of those feelings of psychological distance from climate change may be influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs about the levels of risk, as well as by actual exposure to hazards <xref rid="pone.0103180-Slovic1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For example, the perception of increased climate change risk to the self and family is linked to willingness to change behaviors <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Similarly, when people consider possible local adaptations to climate change&#x02014;an action that likely increases thoughts about local risk&#x02014;this also increases their willingness to take personal action to reduce emissions <xref rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. More directly, personal experience with climate change effects, such as flooding or extreme weather events, is related to greater climate change concern <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, especially when the events are recognized as related to climate change <xref rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Even experiencing a warmer-than-usual day increases climate change concern <xref rid="pone.0103180-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Zaval1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In general, exposure to personal risk or awareness of greater personal risk increases concern and/or willingness to act.</p><p>Since prior experience of weather events is intrinsically related to the region in which one lives, geographic location is another factor with the strong possibility of affecting psychological distance to climate change. In particular, in the present paper we focus on proximity to the coastline. Although all types of regions will experience climate changes of varying levels of severity, an IPCC report suggests that, in addition to mountain settlements and megacities, coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change <xref rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, possibly because they must bear the brunt of sea-level rise, changing wind patterns, and/or increasingly severe tropical storms <xref rid="pone.0103180-Nicholls1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, coastal dwellers' experience of current climate change impacts may be increased, and this may in turn lower their psychological distance to climate change&#x02013;&#x02013;that is, they may take warnings of climate change more seriously because they feel they are beginning to experience it themselves. Accordingly, some studies have already focused on perceptions of risk near the coastline. For example, Brody et al. <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> showed in a U.S. study that risk from climate change is perceived to be significantly lower for respondents located farther away from the coastline. Indeed, among the other geo-physical variables considered in this study (e.g., relative elevation, sea-level rise/inundation risk, temperature trend), distance to the coast had the strongest association with climate change risk perception. Further, in another national sample of U.S. residents, Brody et al. <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> found proximity to the coast to be significantly and positively related to willingness to reduce personal emissions.</p><p>These U.S. findings support the view that proximity to the coast is an important variable to consider when examining public risk perception and willingness to act in response to climate change. Given that no similar studies have been conducted outside of the U.S., we chose to examine the distance to coast effect in a national probability sample of a coastal nation: New Zealand. We measured climate change belief and support for government action to regulate emissions, two similar but distinct outcome variables compared to previous ones (i.e., risk perception and willingness to reduce personal emissions). In addition to the value of such a study for Australasian researchers and policymakers, we hope that an independent study, conducted on a different national sample, will have international relevance by adding confidence that proximity affects climate change attitudes in general. The findings could also have theoretical implication for the psychological distance of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study analyzed data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), which is a larger longitudinal research project.

This index allocates a deprivation score to each meshblock based on the following nine variables in the census data (in weighted order): proportion of adults receiving a means-tested Government-supplied welfare benefit, household income, proportion not owning their own home, proportion of single-parent families, proportion unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion with household crowding, proportion with no telephone access, and proportion with no car access. The Deprivation Index thus reflects the average level of deprivation for neighborhoods (or small community areas) across the entire country.

With the present data, geographic location is one level and individuals another: One would expect that individuals from a given area (within-group variance) would have more similar characteristics than individuals from different areas (between-group variance). Multilevel analysis allows researchers to model the area-level and individual-level variance independently and simultaneously. We therefore constructed a multilevel model assessing the association between distance to the coast and both belief about the reality of climate change and support for government regulation of carbon emissions. These two outcomes were modelled simultaneously, and their Level 1 and Level 2 residual covariances were also included to adjust for residual associations. The intercepts for both outcomes were modelled as random effects, thus allowing the mean level of each outcome to vary across meshblocks.</p><p>We employed Maximum Likelihood with Robust estimation of the standard errors to adjust for possible non-normality of the residuals <xref rid="pone.0103180-Christ1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We first tested a model including only distance to the coast. We then tested a model that included sex, age, education, household income and political orientation at Level 1, and distance to the coast, height above sea level, the interaction between distance and height, and the level of economic deprivation of each meshblock at Level 2. This approach statistically adjusted for height above sea level, the interaction of height with distance, and the level of regional deprivation when assessing the association between distance to the coast and climate change attitudes, while also modelling the association between respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation and wealth on within-cluster variance. As noted above, studies have found that sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth are all related to environmental concern <xref rid="pone.0103180-Fairbrother1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

As predicted, distance from the coast significantly predicted decreased levels of belief in climate change (b&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;.038, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.004) and lower levels of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;.036, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.005). These unstandardized coefficients indicate that for every additional 10 km from the coast that residents live, they are likely to be .038 units lower in their belief in climate change, and .036 units lower in their support for government regulation of carbon emissions. Considering that ratings of the two outcomes ranged from a minimum possible value of 1 to a maximum of 7 (a total of 6 units), our model therefore indicates that someone who lives 100 km from the coastline will be on average .38 units lower in their belief in climate change [.38&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10 * .038], or roughly 6.3% of the total possible scale range lower [6.33&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(.38/6) * 100], compared to someone who lives by the coastline. In New Zealand, the maximum distance from the coastline a person could reside is approximately 177 km. The effect of proximity is relatively small, but still statistically significant even considering the small geographical area of the country.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0103180-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0103180.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Multilevel Random Coefficient Models assessing the associations between distance to the coast and climate change belief and support for government regulation of carbon emissions.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0103180-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0103180.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">b</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">se</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">t</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

These findings are in line with the other two studies showing that proximity to the coast is related to greater risk perception associated with global climate change <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and with greater willingness to lower personal emissions <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Altogether, the findings demonstrate the importance of geographic location in engaging with the problem of climate change, expanding the profile of our understanding of climate-change-related perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.</p><p>In all three studies, the findings indicate an association only; the studies were not able to discover the direction of the causal arrow. It may be that people with stronger belief in climate change tend to seek out coastal areas, or there might be some third variable (e.g., connectedness to nature) that causes both an increase in climate change belief and the tendency to reside in coastal areas. However, the theory of psychological distance <xref rid="pone.0103180-Milfont1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> predicts that the experience or perception of greater climate change impacts, such as can be expected at the coasts <xref rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, will bring the issue psychologically closer. This, in turn, is predicted to at least partially cause an increase in related variables such as belief in climate change.</p><p>Proximity to the coast certainly allows several possible ways in which belief in climate change could increase. For example, people residing at the coasts may be more likely to 1) experience large, climate-change-related impacts such as flooding and storms <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, many of which are likely to have greater impact on coastal communities <xref rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 2) consider potential sea-level rise, which may require local adaptation <xref rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, or 3) pay more attention to the local weather, as they plan to spend time outdoors at the beach. People residing at the coasts may also have an increased attunement to natural risk, since the ocean, as a large and constantly agitated body of water, may inspire a sense of respect for the power of nature and its changeability, and/or they may have an increased attunement to environmental problems of all types because such residents may care about the state of their beaches, pay attention to them, and have seen problems occur before. In sum, although the presented results are only an association, we note that such a causal relationship is consistent with psychological distance theory <xref rid="pone.0103180-Milfont1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Future research should seek to discover causality wherever possible. Longitudinal studies may be of interest; for example, researchers could examine climate-change-related variables across time among people who have moved closer to or more distant from the coast. Researchers could also consider including an item that specifically measures feelings of closeness or distance from climate change so that they can observe whether individual variables affect psychological distance in different ways. For example, weather-aware individuals may feel closer to climate change than others, but perhaps there is no difference between people who do or do not pay attention to the state of their beaches. Where possible, researchers should also specifically test for mediation by psychological distance. Statistical mediation tests the hypothesis that a mediator variable, such as psychological distance, is the intermediate cause between two other variables. For example, one could test the hypothesis that proximity to the coast causes an increase in psychological closeness to climate change, which in turn causes an increase in climate change belief.</p><p>There are, of course, other factors affecting climate change concern besides psychological distance. We have already mentioned that there are effects of socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, education, wealth, and political orientation <xref rid="pone.0103180-Fairbrother1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, along with a variety of psychological barriers <xref rid="pone.0103180-Gifford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Swim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, there is evidence that climate change concern is also affected by personality factors, such as individuals' traits and tendency to consider the potential future consequences of their actions <xref rid="pone.0103180-Milfont3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103180-Milfont5" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, as well as one's trust in scientists <xref rid="pone.0103180-Malka1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and (dis)belief in conspiracy theories <xref rid="pone.0103180-Lewandowsky1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, however, communicators are not in a position to change many of these other factors, such as personality factors and individual wealth. What the psychological distance evidence suggests, though, is that they may be able to create targeted campaigns&#x02014;for example, discussing with individual metropolitan areas the effects they might expect to experience, and how to prepare for them. (This specific tactic has already been tested, resulting in an increase in willingness to reduce personal emissions <xref rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.) Another tactic might include encouraging people to consider more deeply their experiences of local weather and environmental habitats, which may have already changed during their lifetimes&#x02014;for example, unprecedented pine beetle outbreaks in North America have caused visible damage to forest areas <xref rid="pone.0103180-Kurz1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Additionally, if the goal is to increase awareness of the risks in general, expending more energy on inland communities may be helpful, as it is clear that coastal communities are already slightly more risk-aware <xref rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Ultimately, our findings support the view that psychological distance theory has important practical implications for climate change communication.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0103180-Anderegg1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
